    "### Multinomial Logistic Regression Models\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've been using logistic regression for binary problems where there are only two class labels. Logistic regression can also be extended to dependent variables with multiple classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways scikit-learn solves multiple class problems with logistic regression: a multinomial loss or a \"one-versus-rest\" (OvR) process in which a model is fit for each target class versus all of the other classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Multinomial vs. OvR**\n",
    "- (both) `k` classes.\n",
    "- (M) `k-1` models with one reference category.\n",
    "- (OvR) `k*(k-1)/2` models.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll use grid search in conjunction with multinomial logistic regression to optimize a model that predicts the category (type) of crime based on various features captured by San Francisco police departments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than use the [OneVsRestClassifier](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier.html), we're going to practice building individual models optimized to predict on _one class versus the rest_ for this lab."
