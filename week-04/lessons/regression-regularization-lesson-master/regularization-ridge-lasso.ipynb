    "Regularization methods like the ridge and the lasso add this additional \"penalty\" on the size of coefficients to the loss function. When the loss function is minimized, this additional component is added to the residual sum of squares.\n",

    "\n",
    "**To demonstrate, we will be using a data set on wine quality.**\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that there is **multicollinearity** in the data set, which means there is a high correlation between the predictor variables in your model. Because of this, we might choose to use regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multicollinearity can lead to a variety of problems and complications, including:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The effects of predictor variables estimated by your regression will depend on the other variables included in your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Predictors can have very different effects depending on the observations in your sample, and small changes in samples can result in very different estimated effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) With high multicollinearity, the inverse matrix the computer calculates may not be accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) When predictors are strongly correlated, it's not possible for one variable to change without a conditional change in another variable. Therefore, we can no longer interpret a coefficient on a variable as the effect on the target of a one-unit increase in that variable holding the other variables constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ridge is best suited to deal with multicollinearity. Lasso also handles multicollinearity between variables but in a more extreme way (i.e., it \"zeroes out\" the less-effective variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "The lasso is particularly useful when you have redundant or unimportant variables. If you have 1,000 variables in a data set, the lasso can automatically perform \"feature selection\" by forcing coefficients to be zero."
